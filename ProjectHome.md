Pages is a monome application that allows the simultaneous execution of multiple other monome applications on any number of devices.  There are many built in applications as well, including MIDI interfaces (keyboard, triggers, faders, sequencers), Ableton clip launcher interfaces, and a way to easily script your own programs with Groovy.

Pages speaks both SerialOSC and MonomeSerial protocols and can be used with any grid-like device that speaks either protocol.  Any combination of SerialOSC and MonomeSerial applications can be used via the External Application page.
